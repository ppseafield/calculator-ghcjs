* GHCJS testing project: Calculator GHCJS

** Element, HTMLElement, HTMLButtonElement different types
   Nice but cumbersome by itself. I'm sure other libraries make this nicer.

** OverloadedStrings/IsString + To/FromJSString = madness
   Because I had OverloadedStrings on, a string literal could be a String, Text, etc., and
   then the ToJSString could be any ToJSString String, ToJSString Text, etc. GHC couldn't infer
   what type I wanted, so I had to sprinkle some ":: String" and ":: IO String" in the code.
